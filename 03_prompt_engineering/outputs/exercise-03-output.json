By employing coherent coupling techniques and precision microwave pulse sequencing, researchers demonstrated a quantum state fidelity of 99.7% across a two-qubit system. The experimental setup utilized a dilution refrigerator maintained at 10 millikelvin to minimize thermal decoherence and employed a hybrid aluminum-niobium resonator architecture to enhance quantum coherence times."
